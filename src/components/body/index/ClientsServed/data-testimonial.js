      'With the start of exclusively virtual meetings (due to the pandemic) we started recording the meetings. To make them accessible we needed to add captions. We did not have in-house staff that had experience creating captioning files in a format that could be added to the meeting recordings (i.e. SRT files). We now have a reliable source for creating the captioning files we require.',
